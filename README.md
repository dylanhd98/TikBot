# TikBot
## An automated reddit video generator bot with the goal to immitate those seen on TikTok
this program doesnt directly grab screenshots like many other similar ones, it gets the raw text from the reddit api and reconstructs its into something looking like a screenshot, as a consiquence if my code isnt too much of a mess you can customize how screenshots are constructed


### steps to do the cool thing
  1. run the .BAT file to install modules or manually if you wish 
  2. run the .py file (woah)
  3. do the first time set up, this includes following instructions on setting up OAuth2 for reddit application - https://github.com/reddit-archive/reddit/wiki/OAuth2
  4. download background footage with included in-program tool
  5. generate video from scratch, preset(once added), or from post IDs for human curation of posts 
  6. you got the thing now yay!


### todo:
  * text processor, removes unreadable things like links etc
  * blacklist for accounts and/or words to ignore e.g. automod or swearing
  * make faster because it is slow and i want the videos now
  * add presets 
  * add bg audio
  * better module importing for first time setup
  * remove the worse tts voices
  * option to go between narrator style (single random voice for entire video), or convo style(different voice per post and comment)



what it looks like :O
