# TikBot
An automated reddit video generator with the goal to immitate those seen on TikTok

run the .BAT file to install modules or manually if you wish 
run the .py file (woah)
download background footage with included in-program tool
generate video from scratch, preset(once added), or from post IDs for human curation of posts
you got the thing now yay!

todo:
-make faster because it is slow and i want the videos now
-add presets 
-add bg audio
-better module importing for first time setup
-remove the worse tts voices
-option to go between narrator style (single random voice for entire video), or convo style(different voice per post and comment)
